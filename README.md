I developed a model that predicts whether people have diabetes or not based on the information given in this data set. For this model I used KNN, CART, RF, XGBoost, LightGBM, CATBoost. Among these models, I chose the most successful model with VotingClassifier.

Context

SkinThickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
